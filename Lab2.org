* Video Notes
** Equipment
*** Dc Power Supply
*** Model Transmission Line
*** Multi-meters
*** Synchronization unit
** Experimental Procedure
- Load Switch Disabled
- 3-Phase power supply connected to load switch
- 3-Phase Wattmeter connected to the three phase supply
- Three Phase supply connected to the stator of the synchronous motor
- Dc power supply connected to synchronous machine rotor
- DC Power supply switched on
- DC Power to motor increased gradually
- DC Motor begins to turn Drive train at =V\approx8-11Vdc=

*** synchronisation
- Dc voltage increased until DC motor is running at synchronous speed =\approx1500rpm=
- Second DC Supply turned on to exit the rotor
- Excitation Current increased gradually
- Generator open circuit voltage noted as changing as excitation current to the rotor is increased?
- Machine is Disabled

*** Open circuit Test
- Name Plate Rating of the Synchronous machine noted

  | Stator Voltage (V) | Stator Voltage +20% (V) | Rotor Voltage (VDC) | Power (W) @1500 rpm |
  |--------------------+-------------------------+---------------------+---------------------|
  |               41.5 |                    49.8 |                  24 |                  50 |
    #+TBLFM: $2=$1 1.2

- Additional =20%= margin added to stator voltage rating
- DC Motor restarted
- Synchronous motor spun up to =1500rpm=
- The Generator side of the synchronisation unit is disconnected
- The Rotor excitation current is set to =0A=
- The rotor excitation current is increased in steps of =0.5A= until the measured stator voltage reaches =49.8V= (calculated according to: \(1.2\times V_{\text{stator Name-Plate}}\)).
  + for each =0.5A= step the synchronous speed was controlled to =1500rpm= by adjusting the supply to the DC Motor
  + for each step of =0.5A= the open circuit generator voltage was recorded

*** Short Circuit Test
- The leads leaving the 3 Phase wattmeter which were disconnected Last experiment are now connected together effectively short-circuiting the Generator
- The rotor field supply is set to zero and the supply is switched on
- The DC Motor is turned on and the DC voltage supply is adjusted until the speed of the drive train is at 1500 rpm
- Rotor field excitation current gradually increased in steps of =0.05A=
  + rotor speed is kept constant at =1500rpm= for each step
  + for each step the current flowing out of the generator terminals is noted

*** Load Test
**** Synchronisation
- Synchronous machine used as a generator into an infinite bus
- A 3-Phase Power supply is used to simulate the grid
- Load switch is set to =Off= on the synchronisation unit
- The Synchronisation unit is set to =Intensity=
- The leads between the Synchronisation unit and the 3-Phase Wattmeter are reconnected
- The DC supply to the DC motor is switched on and the supply voltage is adjusted until the speed of the generator reaches =1500rpm=
- The DC Rotor supply is now turned on and the current is adjusted until the generator line voltage is =45V= which is the same amplitude of the 3-Phase supply
- The thee phase supply is now turned on
  + It is noted that the three lights on the synchronisation unit now begin to flash at =\approx0.5Hz=
- The motor speed is then adjusted by varying the DC motor current until the lights cease to flash.
- The Load switch is now set to =On=
  + it is noted that the lights now Cease to flash meaning the synchronous machine is now synchronised with the 3-Phase supply

- The Rotor field excitation current and the DC Motor Current (its torque) is adjusted to minimise the AC stator current
  + the generator is neither motoring or generating with losses supplied by the DC motor (no real power is flowing between the grid and the synchronous machine)

- The Current to the DC motor is increased until the stator current is roughly \(2/3\; I_{nom}\) which is calculated as =464mA=
  + I Guess this will be primarily real power
- the rotor excitation current is then adjusted until the stator current is minimised
  + cancelling out the reactive power by altering the magnitude of the EMF?
- Once the stator current is minimised, the following are recorded
  + Final stator current
  + Prime mover input power
  + rotor excitation current
  + Terminal voltage
  + Power factor
  + rotor angle
- the synchronous speed of the rotor is then measured with the lamp thing

**** second test - Step 4
- The rotor excitation current is increased until the stator current reaches its nominal value.
  + the Prime-mover torque is kept constant
- The following are recorded:
  + Final stator current
  + Prime mover input power
  + rotor excitation current
  + Terminal voltage
  + Power factor
  + rotor angle

**** Third test - Step 5
- 24:29
- DC Motor Power is kept constant
- Rotor excitation current is reduced to the value measured in step 3: =478mA=
- Rotor excitation current is continually reduced until the stator current reaches its nominal value
- The following are recorded at this point:
  + Final stator current
  + Prime mover input power
  + rotor excitation current
  + Terminal voltage
  + Power factor
  + rotor angle
- the synchronising switch is opened and all power supplys are turned off
