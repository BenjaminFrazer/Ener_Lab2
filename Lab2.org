** Load Tests
*** Setup (Steps 1-2)
**** Synchronisation - (Step 1)
- Synchronous machine used as a generator into an infinite bus
- A 3-Phase Power supply is used to simulate the grid
- Load switch is set to =Off= on the synchronisation unit
- The Synchronisation unit is set to =Intensity=
- The leads between the Synchronisation unit and the 3-Phase Wattmeter are reconnected
- The DC supply to the DC motor is switched on and the supply voltage is adjusted until the speed of the generator reaches =1500rpm=
- The DC Rotor supply is now turned on and the current is adjusted until the generator line voltage is =45V= which is the same amplitude of the 3-Phase supply
- The thee phase supply is now turned on
  + It is noted that the three lights on the synchronisation unit now begin to flash at =\approx0.5Hz=
- The motor speed is then adjusted by varying the DC motor current until the lights cease to flash.
- The Load switch is now set to =On=
  + it is noted that the lights now Cease to flash meaning the synchronous machine is now synchronised with the 3-Phase supply

**** Zero Apparent power flow - (Step 2)
- The Rotor field excitation current and the DC Motor Current (its torque) is adjusted to minimise the AC stator current
  + the generator is neither motoring or generating with losses supplied by the DC motor (no real power is flowing between the grid and the synchronous machine)

*** Test 1 - Generating with unity power factor (Zero Q)- (Step 3)
**** Procedure
- The Current to the DC motor is increased until the stator current is roughly \(2/3\; I_{nom}\) which is calculated as =464mA=
  + I Guess this will be primarily real power
- the rotor excitation current is then adjusted until the stator current is minimised
  + cancelling out the reactive power by altering the magnitude of the EMF?
- Once the stator current is minimised, the following are recorded
  + Final stator current
  + Prime mover input power
  + rotor excitation current
  + Terminal voltage
  + Power factor
  + rotor angle
- the synchronous speed of the rotor is then measured with the lamp thing

***  Test 2 - Generating at rated current (Positive Q) - (Step 4)
**** Procedure
- The rotor excitation current is increased until the stator current reaches its nominal value.
  + the Prime-mover torque is kept constant
- The following are recorded:
  + Final stator current
  + Prime mover input power
  + rotor excitation current
  + Terminal voltage
  + Power factor
  + rotor angle

*** Test 3 Generating at rated current (Negative Q) - (Step 5)
**** Procedure
- 24:29
- DC Motor Power is kept constant
- Rotor excitation current is reduced to the value measured in step 3: =478mA=
- Rotor excitation current is continually reduced until the stator current reaches its nominal value
- The following are recorded at this point:
  + Final stator current
  + Prime mover input power
  + rotor excitation current
  + Terminal voltage
  + Power factor
  + rotor angle
- the synchronising switch is opened and all power supplies are turned off
