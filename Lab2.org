** Load Tests
*** Setup (Steps 1-2)
**** Synchronisation - (Step 1)
- Synchronous machine used as a generator into an infinite bus
- A 3-Phase Power supply is used to simulate the grid
- Load switch is set to =Off= on the synchronisation unit
- The Synchronisation unit is set to =Intensity=
- The leads between the Synchronisation unit and the 3-Phase Wattmeter are reconnected
- The DC supply to the DC motor is switched on and the supply voltage is adjusted until the speed of the generator reaches =1500rpm=
- The DC Rotor supply is now turned on and the current is adjusted until the generator line voltage is =45V= which is the same amplitude of the 3-Phase supply
- The thee phase supply is now turned on
  + It is noted that the three lights on the synchronisation unit now begin to flash at \approx =0.5Hz=
- The motor speed is then adjusted by varying the DC motor current until the lights cease to flash.
- The Load switch is now set to =On=
  + it is noted that the lights now Cease to flash meaning the synchronous machine is now synchronised with the 3-Phase supply

**** Zero Apparent power flow - (Step 2)
- The Rotor field excitation current and the DC Motor Current (its torque) is adjusted to minimise the AC stator current
  + the generator is neither motoring or generating with losses supplied by the DC motor (no real power is flowing between the grid and the synchronous machine)

*** Test 1 - Unity PF (Step 3)
**** Procedure
- The Current to the DC motor is increased until the stator current is roughly \(2/3\; I_{nom}\) which is calculated as =464mA=
  + I Guess this will be primarily real power
- the rotor excitation current is then adjusted until the stator current is minimised
  + cancelling out the reactive power by altering the magnitude of the EMF?
- Once the stator current is minimised, the following are recorded
  + Final stator current
  + Prime mover input power
  + rotor excitation current
  + Terminal voltage
  + Power factor
  + rotor angle
- the synchronous speed of the rotor is then measured with the lamp thing

* Deductions
** Synchronous Impedance Plot
<<sectSynchronousImpedancePlot>>
The results for the short-circuit and open circuit tests are plotted in Figure ref:figSynchrinousImpedance along with the synchronous impedance calculated from both lines by interpolation. The synchronous impedance is defined according to Formula ref:eqSyncrinousImpedance which can be derived according to the equivalent circuit of the synchronous machine.
#+NAME: eqSyncrinousImpedance
\begin{align}
Z_s= \frac{V_{EMF}}{I_{Ph}}
\end{align}
Since it is impossible to directly measured the V_{EMF} while current is flowing through the terminals of the synchronous machine, we must first establish V_{EMF} from the open circuit test. Since it is known that \(V_{EMF}\propto I_{rot}\) We record the OC voltage against different rotor excitation currents and similarly record the SC stator currents against rotor excitation current. Since \(V_{OCLL}(V_{rot})\times \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}=V_{EMF}(V_{rot})\) the SC current at a given I_{rot} can be assumed to be driven by the V_{EMF} for that same I_{rot}.

Complicating this somewhat is the fact that the measurements for V_{EMF} and I_{Ph} are not taken at the exact same rotor excitation current (I_{rot}), as such a 1D linear interpolation is used over the range of valid[fn::Some of the initial measurements of I_{stat} read zero and as such would lead to a divide by zero in Eq ref:eqSyncrinousImpedance and as such have been excluded] Short circuit measurements (I_{stat}). Figure ref:figSynchrinousImpedance attempts to show the interpolation with the dotted red lines showing the x axis points chosen to evaluate Z_s. for simplicity the points are chosen to coincide with the actual measurements of I_{stat} so interpolation was only conducted on V_{Ph} [fn:: the interpolated points on V_{stat} are highlighted as red markers on the V_{stat} line]. Finally the calculated Z_s for each point is plotted (shown in red). As can be seen from the flat nature of the line, Calculated Z_s is basically constant over the selected range of I_{rot}.

\end{align}

The base impedance is then used to calculate the per unit impedance according to Equation ref:eqZs_pu, yielding call_calcPuImpedance() Pu.
#+NAME: eqZs_pu
\begin{align}
Z_{s(pu)} = \frac{Z_{s}}{Z_{base}}
\end{align}

** Calculations
*** Current angle
The angle of the current with respect to the supply voltage vector at the 3-Phase Wattmeter, can be derived from the power factor:
#+NAME: eqAngle
\begin{align}
\theta =-cos^{-1}(pf)
\end{align}
Where pf is positive, and:
#+NAME: eqAngle_neg
\begin{align}
\theta =cos^{-1}(-pf)
\end{align}

*** Voltage drop (v_d)
Since the load impedance is known, the magnitude of the voltage drop can be calculated according to:
#+NAME: eqAbsVoltageDrop
\begin{align}
V_d = I_{stat}\angle\theta\degree \times Z_s = I_{stat}\angle\theta\degree \times jX_s
\end{align}

*** V_EMF Calculation
From the equivalent circuit diagram and applying Kirchhoff's voltage law we know that V_{EMF} of the generator is given by:
#+NAME: eqV_Emf
\begin{align}
V_{EMF} = V_{supply}\angle0\degree +V_d
\end{align}

Where V_{supply} is the complex phasor corresponding to the supply voltage and V_d is the voltage drop over the reactive impedance Z_s. Substituting Equation ref:eqAbsVoltageDrop into ref:eqV_Emf we get:

#+NAME: eqV_Emf2
\begin{align}
V_{EMF} = V_{supply}\angle0\degree +I_{stat}\angle\theta\degree \times jX_s
\end{align}
*** Reacive Power Calculation
Rective power is calculated based on the measured stator current magnitude \(|I_{stat}|\), the measured magnitude of stator voltage (\(|V_{stat}|\)) and the measured power factor accoring to Equation ref:eqReactivePower.
#+NAME: eqReactivePower
\begin{align}
Q = \frac{3\times I_{stat}V_{stat LL}}{\sqrt{3}}\times \sqrt{1-pf^2}
\end{align}
*** Real Power Calculation
#+NAME: eqRealPower
\begin{align}
P = \frac{3\times I_{stat}V_{stat LL}}{\sqrt{3}}\times pf
\end{align}

** Calculation Results
The tabulated calculations of V_EMF, I_rot and Power for each of the three load tests are displayed in Table ref:tabExcitationCurrentsAndPow. The corresponding phasor diagrams are shown in Figures ref:figTest1UnityPf to ref:figTest3LeadingPf.

*** Rotor Angle
The rotor angle is also caclulated implicitly since is is simply the angle of the derived V_EMF (Table ref:tabExcitationCurrentsAndPow). 

*** Field excitation currents
 Excitation current is caclulated derived from the magnitude of V_EMF and the known relationship between field excitation current and V_EMF magnitude establised in Section ref:sectSynchronousImpedancePlot. This may then be compared against the measured value as a validations step. From Table ref:tabExcitationCurrentsAndPow it is clear that these values match very closely, only differing for test two, possibly due to having to extrapolate outwith the range of the known I_rot vs V_EMF relationship.
 
*** P/Q vs Excitation
Reactive power is calculated according to Equations ref:eqReactivePower and ref:eqRealPower, and again found in Table ref:tabExcitationCurrentsAndPow. It seems clear for the experimental results that the effect of raising and lowering the excitation current affects both the real and reactive power leaving the generator, however reactive power is substantially more sensitive to this than real power. While real power varied only by several % from nominal, the reactive power flipped between \approx =+0.5pu= reactive power at the high end of excitation and, \approx =-0.5pu=  on the low end of excitation. This implies that higher excitation, and by extension higher V_EMF leads to more reactive power export, while conversely low excitation leads to reactive power import.

** Over vs Under excitation
From the results obtained in this lab is can be seen that operating under excited i.e. with lagging power factor, acts to increase the total load angle of the machine. This means that the total stability margin of the machine in steady state is reduced for the same real power.
